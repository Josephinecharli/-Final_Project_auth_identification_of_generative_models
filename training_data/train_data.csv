"id1001","sea we must wade. We braved the belly of the beast. We’ve learned that quiet isn’t always peace, and the","AG"
"id1002","norms and notions of what “just” is isn’t always justice. And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it.","AG"
"id1003","Somehow we do it. Somehow we weathered and witnessed a nation that isn’t broken, but simply unfinished. We, the successors","AG"
"id1004","of a country and a time where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother","AG"
"id1005","can dream of becoming president, only to find herself reciting for one. And, yes, we are far from polished, far","AG"
"id1006","from pristine, but that doesn’t mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect. We are striving to","AG"
"id1007","forge our union with purpose. To compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and conditions of man. And","AG"
"id1008","so we lift our gaze, not to what stands between us, but what stands before us. We close the divide","AG"
"id1009","because we know to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside. We lay down our arms","AG"
"id1010","so we can reach out our arms to one another. We seek harm to none and harmony for all. Let","AG"
"id1011","the globe, if nothing else, say this is true. That even as we grieved, we grew. That even as we","AG"
"id1012","hurt, we hoped. That even as we tired, we tried. That we’ll forever be tied together, victorious. Not because we","AG"
"id1013","will never again know defeat, but because we will never again sow division. 2 Scripture tells us to envision that","AG"
"id1014","everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree, and no one shall make them afraid. If we’re to","AG"
"id1015","live up to our own time, then victory won’t lie in the blade, but in all the bridges we’ve made.","AG"
"id1016","That is the promise to glade, the hill we climb, if only we dare. It’s because being American is more","AG"
"id1017","than a pride we inherit. It’s the past we step into and how we repair it. We’ve seen a force","AG"
"id1018","that would shatter our nation, rather than share it. Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy. And this","AG"
"id1019","effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated. In this truth,","AG"
"id1020","in this faith we trust, for while we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us.","AG"
"id1021","This is the era of just redemption. We feared at its inception. We did not feel prepared to be the","AG"
"id1022","heirs of such a terrifying hour. But within it we found the power to author a new chapter, to offer","AG"
"id1023","hope and laughter to ourselves. So, while once we asked, how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe, now we assert,","AG"
"id1024","how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us? We will not march back to what was, but move to what shall","AG"
"id1025","be: a country that is bruised but whole, benevolent but bold, fierce and free. We will not be turned around","AG"
"id1026","or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation, become","AG"
"id1027","the future. Our blunders become their burdens. But one thing is certain. If we merge mercy with might, and might","AG"
"id1028","with right, then love becomes our legacy and change our children’s birthright. So let us leave behind a country better","AG"
"id1029","than the one we were left. Every breath from my bronze pounded chest, we will raise this wounded world into a","AG"
"id1030","wondrous one. We will rise from the golden hills of the West. We will rise from the windswept Northeast where","AG"
"id1031","our forefathers first realized revolution. We will rise from the lake rimmed cities of the Midwestern states. We will rise from","AG"
"id1032","the sun baked South. We will rebuild, reconcile, and recover. And every known nook of our nation and every corner called","AG"
"id1033","our country, our people diverse and beautiful, will emerge battered and beautiful. When day comes, we step out of the","AG"
"id1034","shade of flame and unafraid. The new dawn balloons as we free it. For there is always light, if only","AG"
"id1035","we’re brave enough to see it. If only we’re brave enough to be it. There’s a poem in this place—","AG"
"id1036","in the footfalls in the halls in the quiet beat of the seats. It is here, at the curtain of","AG"
"id1037","day, where America writes a lyric you must whisper to say. There’s a poem in this place— in the heavy","AG"

"id1056","Hope— we must bestow it like a wick in the poet so it can grow, lit, bringing with it stories","AG"
"id1057","to rewrite— the story of a Texas city depleted but not defeated a history written that need not be repeated","AG"

"id1062","song of dawn’s bell where we write an American lyric we are just beginning to tell. I thought I’d awaken","AG"
"id1063","to a world in mourning. Heavy clouds crowding, a society storming. But there’s something different on this golden morning. Something","AG"
"id1064","magical in the sunlight, wide and warming. I see a dad with a stroller taking a jog. Across the street,","AG"
"id1065","a bright eyed girl chases her dog. A grandma on a porch fingers her rosaries. She grins as her young neighbor","AG"
"id1066","brings her groceries. While we might feel small, separate, and all alone, Our people have never been more closely tethered.","AG"
"id1067","The question isn’t if we will weather this unknown, But how we will weather this unknown together. So on this","AG"
"id1068","meaningful morn, we mourn and we mend. Like light, we can’t be broken, even when we bend. As one, we","AG"
"id1069","will defeat both despair and disease. We stand with healthcare heroes and all employees; With families, libraries, schools, waiters, artists;","AG"
"id1070","Businesses, restaurants, and hospitals hit hardest. We ignite not in the light, but in lack thereof, For it is in","AG"
"id1071","loss that we truly learn to love. In this chaos, we will discover clarity. In suffering, we must find solidarity.","AG"
"id1072","For it’s our grief that gives us our gratitude, Shows us how to find hope, if we ever lose it.","AG"
"id1073","So ensure that this ache wasn’t endured in vain: Do not ignore the pain. Give it purpose. Use it. Read","AG"
"id1074","children’s books, dance alone to DJ music. Know that this distance will make our hearts grow fonder. From a wave","AG"
"id1075","of woes our world will emerge stronger. We’ll observe how the burdens braved by humankind Are also the moments that","AG"
"id1076","make us humans kind; Let every dawn find us courageous, brought closer; Heeding the light before the fight is over.","AG"

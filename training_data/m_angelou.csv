"id4033","eyes on distant arrangements of lights so as to return to wet and wild nests? Our heads tilt up and","MA"
"id4034","up and we are careful to never look at each other. You were born on a day of peaches splitting","MA"
"id4035","from so much rain and the slick smell of fresh tar and asphalt pushed over a cracked parking lot. You","MA"

"id4040","I want to spread those little meteors on a hunk of still warm bread this winter. Any trace left on the","MA"

I don't remember how I hurt myself,
The pain mine
Long enough for me 
To lose the wound that invented it
As none of us knows the beauty
Of our own eyes
Until a man tells us they are
Why God made brown.  Then
That same man says he lives to touch
The smoothest parts, suggesting our
Surface area can be understood 
By degrees of satin.  Him I will 
Follow until I am as rough outside
As I am within.  I cannot locate the origin 
Of slaughter, but I know
How my own feels, that I live with it
And sometimes use it
To get the living done
Because I am what gladiators call
A man in love—love 
Being any reminder we survived.
Not the palm, not the pear tree
Switch, not the broomstick,
Nor the closest extension
Cord, not his braided belt, but God,
Bless the back of my daddy’s hand
Which, holding nothing tightly
Against me and not wrapped
In leather, eliminated the air
Between itself and my cheek.
Make full this dimpled cheek
Unworthy of its unfisted print
And forgive my forgetting
The love of a hand
Hungry for reflex, a hand that took
No thought of its target
Like hail from a blind sky,
Involuntary, fast, but brutal
In its bruising. Father, I bear the bridge
Of what might have been
A broken nose. I lift to you
What was a busted lip. Bless
The boy who believes
His best beatings lack
Intention, the mark of the beast. 
Bring back to life the son
Who glories in the sin
Of immediacy, calling it love.
God, save the man whose arm
Like an angel’s invisible wing
May fly backward in fury
Whether or not his son stands near. 
Help me hold in place my blazing jaw
As I think to say excuse me.
